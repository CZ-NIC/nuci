# The script checks if the router still has a valid contract. If so, it makes
# sure the i_agree_datacollect user list is enabled.
#
# This should be run after installation. Also, we want to run it periodically,
# for two reasons. One, we want to readd it if user removes it. Another, if the
# internet connection doesn't work when we run it after the installation, it
# would add nothing, so we want to fix that.
